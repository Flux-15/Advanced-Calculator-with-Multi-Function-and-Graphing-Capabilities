# Advanced-Calculator-with-Multi-Function-and-Graphing-Capabilities
This project is an advanced MATLAB calculator designed to handle a variety of mathematical tasks, including complex calculations, symbolic equation solving, and graph plotting. The calculator features:

1.	Basic Operations: Perform fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. It also includes advanced functions like square root, logarithms (base 10 and natural), and trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent) with angle inputs in degrees.
2.	Equation Solving: Solve symbolic equations provided by the user. The script converts the input string to a symbolic expression, uses MATLAB's solve function to find the roots, and displays the solutions.
3.	Graph Plotting: Plot mathematical functions over a specified range. The user inputs a function, which is converted to a MATLAB function for computation. The script generates a plot for the function and includes options to visualize the real parts of the function if complex numbers are present.
4.	Solve and Plot: A combined feature that solves a given equation and plots the function, highlighting the solutions on the graph. This feature integrates both solving and plotting functionalities, providing a comprehensive view of the equationâ€™s behavior and solutions.

The script is designed for users needing an efficient tool for complex calculations and visualization in MATLAB. It supports various mathematical operations, solving equations, and generating graphs, making it a versatile tool for both academic and practical applications.

# Example Workflow
Here's how you might use the script in a real session:

1.	Basic Calculation:
o	Run the script and choose 1 for Basic Operations.

o	Select option 1 for Addition.

o	Input 7 and 8.

o	MATLAB displays Result: 15.

2.	Solve Equation:

o	Run the script and choose 2 for Solve an Equation.

o	Input x^2 - 2*x - 8 = 0.

o	MATLAB shows solutions x = 4 and x = -2.

3.	Plot Function:

o	Run the script and choose 3 for Plot an Equation.

o	Input cos(x).

o	MATLAB displays a plot of cos(x).

4.	Solve and Plot:

o	Run the script and choose 4 for Solve and Plot.

o	Input x^3 - 3*x + 2 = 0.

o	MATLAB shows solutions x = 1 and x = -1 and plots the function with these solutions marked.

5.	Exit:

o	Run the script and choose 5 to exit.
